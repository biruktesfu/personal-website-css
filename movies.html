<h2>Movies</h2>



<div class = "borderRight">

    <p>Watching movies is one of my hobbies. I mostly watch action and horror <br>
        movies. Many of us absolutley adore film and want to see everything that <br>
        comes out, no matter what genre or who is starring it. It is not about the story <br>
        line, there is something else that makes movies magical. Here are some reasons <br>
        i think why movies are so well loved.</p>
        <p>
            <b>A complete art form:</b> Sometimes I might not understandart when <br> 
            it comes to painting, sculpture, or even photography to an extent. However, <br>
            with movies I may appreciate some of the artistry that has gone into <br>
            it. There will be breathtaking scenes, beautiful lines and speeches, and <br>
            amazing special effects.
         </p>
         <p>
             <b> It's a shared experience:</b>When I am watching movie with other <br>
             people, it is a wonderful shared experience that is difficult to find else <br>
             where. When I am watching with a group of frinds at home we can discuss  <br>
             what is going on and i can give my own opinion, and that is always fun and <br>
             makes the experiene a better one.
         </p>
         <p>
             <b>Escapism:</b> Movies help me to escape from real life for a few hours, <br>
             and sometimes that can be a wonderful distraction from everything that is <br>
             going on. Even if life is perfectly fine, taking some time out to enjoy <br>
             something that is entirely  unrelated to your own life can help you to relax <br>
             a little bit.
