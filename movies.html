    <p>Watching movies is one of my hobbies. I mostly watch action and horror 
        movies. Many of us absolutley adore film and want to see everything that 
        comes out, no matter what genre or who is starring it. It is not about the story 
        line, there is something else that makes movies magical. Here are some reasons 
        i think why movies are so well loved.</p>
        <p>
            <b>A complete art form:</b> Sometimes I might not understandart when 
            it comes to painting, sculpture, or even photography to an extent. However, 
            with movies I may appreciate some of the artistry that has gone into 
            it. There will be breathtaking scenes, beautiful lines and speeches, and 
            amazing special effects.
         </p>
         <p>
             <b> It's a shared experience:</b>When I am watching movie with other 
             people, it is a wonderful shared experience that is difficult to find else 
             where. When I am watching with a group of frinds at home we can discuss  
             what is going on and i can give my own opinion, and that is always fun and 
             makes the experiene a better one.
         </p>
         <p>
             <b>Escapism:</b> Movies help me to escape from real life for a few hours,
             and sometimes that can be a wonderful distraction from everything that is 
             going on. Even if life is perfectly fine, taking some time out to enjoy 
             something that is entirely  unrelated to your own life can help you to relax
             a little bit.
