                    Hello there My name is Biruk Tesfaye. I am a Second year IT<img src="assets/images/biruk.jpg" alt="biruk" width="130px" height="100px" > <br /> 
                    student at Addis Ababa institute of technology. I was born in<br>
                    Addis Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia. I finished high school<br>
                    at Glory primary and secondary school. Everyone told me that <br>
                    campus life is very hard and unbearable. They are not wrong <br>
                    , life in here is very hard especially when there are too many <br>
                    projects and assignments to do. But that is why I came here for, to  <br>
                    be educated and get something out of it. My plan is to be an ethical hacker. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethical hacker is a cyber security expert whose job is to try and break in to the <br>
                    company network and access their personal data to ensure it is locked carefully away <br>
                    behind as many levels of security as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>I am also interested in Photshop and 2D animation. I started learning <br>
                    photoshop when the pandemic begun. Since then I have been trying to <br>
                    master Adobe photoshop. I also started learning 2D animation on blender <br>
                    but it is too complex and since class has started I had to pause it. Am looking <br>
                    forward to becoming the best graphic designer.
