                    Hello there My name is Biruk Tesfaye. I am a Second year IT<img src="assets/images/biruk.jpg" alt="biruk" width="130px" height="100px" > <br /> 
                    student at Addis Ababa institute of technology. I was born in
                    Addis Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia. I finished high school
                    at Glory primary and secondary school. Everyone told me that 
                    campus life is very hard and unbearable. They are not wrong 
                    , life in here is very hard especially when there are too many 
                    projects and assignments to do. But that is why I came here for, to  
                    be educated and get something out of it. My plan is to be an ethical hacker. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethical hacker is a cyber security expert whose job is to try and break in to the 
                    company network and access their personal data to ensure it is locked carefully 
                    away behind as many levels of security as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>I am also interested in Photshop and 2D animation. I started learning 
                    photoshop when the pandemic begun. Since, I have been trying to 
                    master Adobe photoshop. I also started learning 2D animation on blender 
                    but it is too complex and since class has started I had to pause it. Am looking 
                    forward to becoming the best graphic designer.
