 <hr>
    <img src="assets/images/glow.jpg" alt="glow" width="539px" height="400px"><br>
<p>
    But perhaps the most important lesson I learned is that
    there are no walls between humans and the elephants 
    except those we put up ourselves and that until we allow
    not only elephants but all living creatures their place
    in the sun, we can never be whole ourselves. In This 
    Photoshop Tutorial,you will learn how to create a night scene
    with a glowing effect. For Final Adjustment, we will use 
    Camera Raw Filter.

    The world is rapidly changing. So maybe you also want
    to change it up a bit? I invite you to dive into the
    world of amazing and surreal photo manipulation 
    “Inception”. This work shows a piece of the digital 
    world. Possible future world. You will learn how to 
    create an abstract composition, interesting techniques 
    and effects, working with a variety of instruments
    and much more! This tutorial will help you improve 
    your skills and open your creative vision!

<p>
    At the beginning of this work is all quite simple,
    work with color, and places of the model. The model
    must be added at the beginning, because it is the
    central object. Adding a city and imposing on it 
    effects. In part with cubes you will need a little
    patience, because you will do a lot to transform 
    them. In the final steps we will add effects and a
     little paint. You need attentiveness, diligence 
        and good humor as possible, any version of Photoshop.
